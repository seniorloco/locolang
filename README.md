<h1>LocoLang - Language created in C++ - Work In Progress</h1>

<h3>LocoLang is a small programming language I'm working on just as a challenge to create a programming language.

LocoLang is being written in C++ (however poorly) and is currently just a project.

When finished I'm hoping to achieve a semi-usable programming language that will be open to everyone!</h3>



To install LocoLang you just need to run the installer and specify a path. Preferably into `C:\Windows\System32` for easy execution.
Otherwise install it anywhere, but in this case you will have to open the command prompt in that folder (every time) containing locoLang.exe.

To run LocoLang open command prompt and run 'locoLang %filename%.loco'.

Doing so will run your code in LocoLang.
