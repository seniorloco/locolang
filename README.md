<h1>LocoLang - Language created in C++ - Work In Progress</h1>

<h3>LocoLang is a small programming language I'm working on just as a challenge to create a programming language.
LocoLang is being written in C++ (however poorly) and is currently just a project.
When finished I'm hoping to achieve a semi-usable programming language that will be open to everyone!</h3>

To run LocoLang open command prompt and run 'locoLang %filename%.loco'.
Doing so will run your code in LocoLang.
