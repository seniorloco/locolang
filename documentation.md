Welcome to LocoLang!

So far this language is very simple and cannot do much, BUT in the future I have bigger plans for it.

For now here's how the language is syntaxed.

Predefined functions:
    `log`

When using these predefined functions it's important to know that functions are followed by parentheses and a semi-colon at the end of the line.
Like so:
    `log("string");`
